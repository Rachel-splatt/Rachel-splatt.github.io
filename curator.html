                        <li><b> listen to user intuition - </b>In our cognitive walkthroughs, we found that our users’ intuition led them to attempt to use our application in a way other than we intended. Our initial reaction was to guide the user to how we wanted them to accomplish tasks, but we ultimately learned it was best to design based on the users’ intuition to increase discoverability and usability.
</li>
                    <li> <b>thinking beyond visual design - </b>User experience encompasses more than the look and feel of an application. This project challenged us to think about other aspects of designing an application for a user, such as data privacy, ethics, and possible legality issues.

              <h2> problem & ideation: </h2>
                  
            <p class="lead2">When ideating our project, my team was inspired by the community of collectors of all types, and wanted to provide them with a way to manage their different collections. Initially, we were inspired by websites such as GoodReads, and VGCollect, apps that help readers and gamers store their collections, respectively. We also looked into more broad collection management sites, like Pinterest. We found two areas in these existing collection sites we thought could use improvement: </p>
                  
            <ul class="tools lead2"><li><b>The Services were unable to cater to a diverse audience of collectors-</b> 
Existing collection management services typically cater to specific types of collections (gamers, readers, coin collectors), we felt we could create a broader audience</li> <li><b>The Services were not robust enough to attract collectors away from current methods-</b>
We thought about collectors who are particular in how they organize their collections. How could we make our service a viable alternative to these existing preferences?
</li></ul>
                  <br>
                  <h2> features: </h2>
                  <p class="lead2">Based on the problems we identified, we focused in on some key features</p>
                  <ul class="tools lead2">
                  <li><b>Collection types are user created-</b>We recognized that a separate collection app for each different type of collector would be unrealistic, so we decided in our app collections and their features would be user created.</li>
                <li> <b>Users decide what attributes their collection items have, allowing for customizable sorting and visualization.</b></li>
                      <li><b>Linked collections-</b>we felt that having different collections managed on one website gave us the unique opportunity for users to link items from different collections, or create sub collections, adding to the organization collectors desire.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h2> user testing: cognitive walkthrough</h2>
            <p class="lead2">We performed a cognitive walkthrough on three different tasks within our app: Creating a new collection, Adding an item to a collection, and Editing the collection template. We noticed that the creation of a new collection with different attributes was challenging for the users, and they expressed some general confusion about our application. </p>
                
                <h2> user testing: think-aloud protocol</h2>
                
            <p class="lead2">Here are some key notes from our think-aloud protocol: </p>
            <ul class="tools lead2"><li>User was confused about the different between creating a “collection template” and adding a new item. Said the term “label” was confusing terminology.</li>
<li>User pressed save after adding one attribute, returning to the home screen. She was surprised by this outcome but realized she was not done and returned to the template creator.</li>
<li>The user was unsure of how to create an attribute “Steps” and what kind of attribute this would be. 
Overall, there was definite confusion about our app and how it could be used, in particular the creation of a new collection.</li></ul>

              <h2> Designing based on feedback </h2>
                  
            <p class="lead2">After user-testing our application, we recognized there was a lot of confusion about our app, so we went back to the drawing board (literally). One of the most confusing things about our app for the user was the concept of creating a collection, and this was a huge part of our redesign.</p>
