One of my friends is gluten free, and always has concerns about what does and does not contain gluten.  I’m a vegetarian, and when I look at a menu, I'm typically only looking at the very small fraction of choices that don’t have meat in them. We found ourselves searching the menu, googling things, and bombarding our server with questions: “Does that have meat in it?” “Are there gluten free buns available?”
<b>I thought, since we all have different diets, why do we all look at the same menu of choices?</b>

I once read testing on paper prototypes or unfinished mockups leads to more honest feeback, plus, I wanted to challenge myself to focus on the interactions of my application and not just the design. <br> <br> For this personal project, I only tested two tasks on two different users, to get some practice. That being said, I think theres a lot more information I could gain from more extensive testing. The tasks I tested for were:</p> <ul class="tools lead3"><li>editing the user profile to monitor "fat" under 40 grams</li><li>visiting the panera bread menu and finding a meal for someone with peanut allergies</li></ul>

                  <ul class="tools lead3">
                <li>Based on user testing, I know I needed to create a more organized scheme for dietary choices in both the filter options and user profile. The experience was not consistent in the two areas which caused some confusion. I decided to use <i>tags.</i> That way, users could search specifically for their preferences, and wouldn't be littered with a bunch of options that don't apply to them.</li>
                <li>The filter adder screen presented too much information to the user, I needed to simplify this.</li>
                    <li> The distinction between an allergy, restriction, and moderation was a bit confusing for the users. I color coded these to make this distinction more apparent.</li>
                <li> Based on user stories, it was important for my app to be convenient for one time use, but I needed to find a way to make this experience consistent with creating a profile. I could tell during my user testing this was a bit confusing as well. They didn't understand why there were two different ways to add restrictions. I decided filters added in <i>my profile</i> would automatically populate when a user viewed a menu, but the user would be able to add and remove tags after the fact as well.</li>
                <li>For an app thats intended use was in a restaurant setting, I intentially chose a dark color scheme for lower lighting.</li>
